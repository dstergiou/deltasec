Information security is a set of strategies for managing the processes, tools, people and policies necessary to prevent, detect, document and counter threats to digital and non-digital information. Although information security used to be considered the job of IT, it has reached a state where it covers the whole organization and it's an integral part of any Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework.

### Cyber capabilities maturity model
If you are not interested in an ISO 27001:2013 certification but you just want to measure your organization and define improvement steps, then we can use our Cyber Capabilities Maturity Model to measure your current capabilities and present a proposal for improvements. 

The model allows for evaluating the organization in ten different domains that cover the whole spectrum of information security and the results can be summarized as seen below:

With our assistance you will be able to define:

* **Goals**: What is the appropriate maturity level for your organization?
* **Priorities**: Which domains need to be addressed first?
* **Actions**: What specific actions can we take to improve each domain?
