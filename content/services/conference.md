If you are looking for a speaker for your next conference, then we can help you by providing an interesting and engaging talk. Our main passions are:

* Cyber Capabilities Maturity Models
* Secure Software Development and SDLCs
* Social Engineering

You can also use our services for panel participation or panel moderation, provided that the panel is addressing topics in the areas that we offer services in. We even love to talk about iGaming, but only about the regulatory side of things - we are not experts in what makes games attractive!

### Sample presentation
The following presentation was given to the students of [MSc Information Security, DSV](http://dsv.su.se/en/education/courses-and-programmes/masters/information-security-120-credits) at Stockholm, Sweden. The students are inviting industry experts to talk about their experience and provide insights to the graduate students. The goal of this presentation was to explain what a CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) does on a daily basis, and what path the students could follow to prepare for a similar position.
