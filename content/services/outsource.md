Outsourcing has become a big part of business nowadays. Organizations choose to outsource their infrastructure, their services or even their human resources. Outsourcing brings convenience, but also relinquishes control to the 3rd party.

In many cases the organization can rely on the fact that the outsourcing provider is proficient in what they do - Amazon Web Service, Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure. But in other cases, the organization might be need to contract with a less-known vendor (for financial, regulatory or other reasons).

We can help you select the proper vendor from an Information Security standpoint. Together with your organization we will evaluate the vendor's capability to deliver according to your security posture and ensure that they won't be adding any unnecessary risk. 

If you are already working with 3rd party vendors, then maybe it's time to perform an audit on them and validate that they remain true to their contractual obligations and that they comply with all relevant regulatory frameworks (think GDPR).
