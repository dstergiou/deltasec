The Vulnerability Assessment Service is a service to identify technical vulnerabilities in existing IT environments. The purpose is to reduce the risk of intrusion or accidental damage that may affect or damage your operations.

By the use of a world-leading technology, we provide our customers with a clear view of how they can easily protect their IT environment, thereby minimizing financial, legal and operational risks and potential damage to the brand.

The service is modular and we can offer everything from a scan of a server with a simple report to recurring scans of entire IT environments with reporting or deeper analysis of results.

As soon as the scanning is completed, and you report is generated, we can help you with prioritizing your actions, describing which vulnerabilities should be addressed in which order and re-test to ensure that the vulnerabilities have been remedied according to the plan.
