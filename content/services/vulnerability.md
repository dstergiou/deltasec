### Vulnerability assessment

The Vulnerability Assessment Service is a service to identify technical vulnerabilities in existing IT environments. The purpose is to reduce the risk of intrusion or accidental damage that may affect or damage your operations.

By the use of a world-leading technology, we provide our customers with a clear view of how they can easily protect their IT environment, thereby minimizing financial, legal and operational risks and potential damage to the brand.

The service is modular and we can offer everything from a scan of a server with a simple report to recurring scans of entire IT environments with reporting or deeper analysis of results.

As soon as the scanning is completed, and you report is generated, we can help you with prioritizing your actions, describing which vulnerabilities should be addressed in which order and re-test to ensure that the vulnerabilities have been remedied according to the plan.

### Penetration testing

If you want to take the health check one step further, and investigate if the vulnerabilities can actually be exploited, then our penetration testing service can help you do exactly that. Through the use of automated tools and manual testing, our service can help you pinpoint the vulnerabilities that actively be exploited and demonstrate to you the impact of the exploitation.

Our specialization (and passion) is testing web applications. Web applications are often a point of entry to organizationsâ€™ networks and are a clear starting place when looking for gaining access to valuable data. We will test  technical flaws like SQL Injections and XSS; as well as  for business logic flaws.
