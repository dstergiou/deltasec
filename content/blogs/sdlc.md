The earlier a security bug is discovered in the development lifecycle, the lesser the cost will be to remedy the bug. This may sound like a clich√©, but we have seen it happening multiple times. And if you don't believe us, believe all the research that been done on the idea of [defect cost curve](https://www.google.se/search?q=defect+cost+curve).

By introducing an SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) into your development processes you ensure that a number of key activities are performed at the appropriate time - activities that can lead to more secure systems and less cost for keeping them secure.

It does not matter if your development team utilizes Agile methodologies, Waterfall, RUP or Prince 2. The key activities you will be implementing are the same - the placement within your specific methodology might differ though. But here is where we come in, identifying the activities that need to be introduced, as well as the stages of introduction.

We love working with open communities and open standards, therefore our SDLC model of choice is [OpenSAMM](http://www.opensamm.org/), by [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page). We, obviously, understand that you might not wish to implement the full model, so here is how we can help:

1. We will conduct an initial assessment to identify which areas are doing great and which areas are lacking
2. We will create a scorecard for your organization (or for your teams) so you can track the pogress as your process improve 
3. We will create a roadmap of where you need (or want) to be - to put it plainly: a roadmap of how much you want to improve
4. We will define the activities needed to follow the roadmap and bring you to your end goal
