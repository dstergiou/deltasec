We realize that the iGaming world has rigorous certifications that can only be undertaken by authorized and (somtimes) pre-approved testing agencies (labs). If this is what you are looking for, we can't help you - not today at least.

But if you are looking for someone to help you prepare your organization before applying for a gaming licence, or you are looking for someone to help you set up your management system in a way taht the testing agencies will find suitable, then look no further.
