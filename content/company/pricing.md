Providing pricing information without having identified the scope of the assignment is tricky. However, what we can offer in terms of pricing, falls under the following categories:

### Short term assignment
For work that is considered short term assignment (less than 20 workhours) an hourly fee will be charged, in agreement with the customer. If we need to expand the scope of work, this will be agreed with the customer in advance.
### Long term assignment
For work that is considered long term assignment (more than 20 hours workhours) an hourle fee will charged, in agreement with the customer (the fee will be less than the fee charged in short term assignments).If we need to expand the scope of work, this will be agreed with the customer in advance.
### Project work
If the customer wishes to engange on a project basis (instead of consulting hours) then a fee will be provided for the whole project. Upon agreement with the customer, the project can commence.
